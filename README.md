# Rosie

Rosie is a Chrome extension that detects undermining language and suggests more confident phrasing to help people represent themselves as the professionals they are.

This extension is named for Rosie the Riveter, who is an American symbol for female empowerment in the workplace. Teaching yourself to write confidently will help you develop a good relationship with your colleagues, negotiate salary offers, and establish your credibility as a professional.

Forbes asserts that using words like “just” or “maybe”, apologizing when unneeded, or using phrases like “I’m no expert” or “I don’t know” all demean confidence in the workplace. We polled over 100 people for words they have identified during business conversations that make themselves sound less confident. From this, we gathered 45 words and phrases that Rosie can identify and offer suggestions for change.

Rosie can be used with Gmail, Google Inbox, Outlook, Yahoo, LinkedIn, and Slack.

We believe that Rosie will be a very powerful tool for working women everywhere and we want to keep improving it to make it even more impactful. We would like to improve our text analysis to include more words and phrases and do sentiment analysis to catch other indicators of low confidence. We also want to improve the text analysis to happen in real time so that as the user edits their message in the Rosie, the text analysis will update automatically with any warnings. Finally, we want to expand support to more websites and give users a way to copy their message into the Rosie extension so that it can be used on any website.
