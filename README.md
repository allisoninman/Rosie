# IWH2018
Project for HackerEarth's International Women's Hackathon: https://www.hackerearth.com/sprints/international-women-hackathon-2018/

# Idea: 

Language is everything. The #1 skill that employers look for is communication, and in many cases, it can make or break someone’s first impression of you.  Research finds that women are very likely to use words in emails that undermine our authority and make us come across as less competent and confident in our abilities. Examples of words and phrases that show this are: “I don’t know if this is right, but…” , “just”, “sorry”, “hopefully”, and “kind of”. 

Oftentimes, we don’t realize we are doing this. To solve this and help women adopt more self-confident, empowering language at work and in life, we introduce Rosie, a Google Chrome extension that detects and warns about self-undermining language when writing emails, messages, or social media posts and provide suggestions for words that do us justice.

# Features that we want to build:
* Functionality that searches text input for self-undermining words and phrases.
* Popup that shows
* Suggestions for ways to change your language to be more assertive and empowering.
* Messages to help you feel more self confident

# Features that are good to have:
* Website to display research
* Guidelines for contributing to our project
* Text analysis on website for larger documents that are not being edited live

# Constraints:
* Limited experience in text analysis
* Advertising the product
* User experience
* Want to show warnings on the screen that don’t make the screen too distracting or busy



# Future Plans:
* Making the project open source
* Write articles about the Chrome extension in blogs and share on social media to spread awareness
* Create similar extensions for other popular browsers like Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge.
